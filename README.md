What our project is about:

Environmap is a high-tech mapping platform with the goal to contribute to and advocate for environmental causes in London by leveraging newly developed tools and approaches. Using the London Underground stations as geographical anchors, Environmap collects and processes important environmental data like air quality indices (for example, NO₂, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀ concentrations), sound level intensities (as decibels), and CO₂ emission levels. The project uses projection mapping to show space-aware and immersive visualisations to give the user a direct and unambiguous vision of spatial ordering of environmental qualities in the city.
Furthermore, the application applies data visualisation paradigms to present complex environmental trends in an amiable yet technically accurate manner. The application applies forecasting modelling algorithms from machine learning paradigms, such as time-series analysis and regression models, to forecast future environmental conditions using past and current data inputs. The algorithms further apply external variables, such as weather patterns and traffic density, to enhance prediction accuracy.
The project is extended to an interactive web and mobile platform, where users can see real-time environmental data, explore predictive simulations, and engage with tailored insights. By bringing together spatial, temporal, and predictive dimensions of environmental monitoring, Environmap empowers policymakers, researchers, and citizens to make informed choices and take proactive steps towards resolving urban environmental problems.
