Summary:
EnvironMap is an initiative that aims to combine the interactive potential of Computer Science with the visual representation an engagement of projection mapping. From processing environmental data and projecting onto a 3D model of London as coloured visualisations, the projection mapping aspect brings statistical representations to life as an emergent living, spatial narrative—give the dynamic environmental conditions of the city life by imbuing them with vitality. In parallel, the interactive tool allows users to drill down through these layers of data in detail, by environmental parameter or time period, to uncover strong, evidence-based narratives. The London boroughs are the research context, chosen for diversity and scope—testing a representative sample of urban challenges and opportunities that can be extrapolated globally. 

We collectively chose this track: AI & Ecological Interaction as we were motivated by the pressing need to fulfil the sustainability goals within the deadline of the UN Global Goals' 2030 looming closer. EnvironMap is a proposal to utilise the emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence and environmental simulation—to transform raw data into readable, usable intelligence. These intelligences are meant to provide policymakers and local communities with the knowledge and understanding they require in making decisions towards the planet being sustainable. The selection of the leading environmental indicators—air, noise pollution, and CO₂ emissions—is symbolic rather than random: Air quality (an important health indicator in urban environments with direct implications for respiratory disease and overall well-being. EnvironMap represents air quality in real-time and highlights areas for improvement, raising public awareness and informing environmental policy in a clear format), Noise pollution (while not well reported, is a significant component of urban health. Constant exposure to high levels of noise has been associated with stress diseases, sleep disturbance, and hearing impairment. The addition of this indicator enhances accuracy in measuring environmental health and its effects on day-to-day life), CO₂ emissions (an ideal indicator for approximating a city's carbon footprint as well as for climate change mitigation. It plots these emissions at the borough scale, showing local hotspots that can be utilised to target policy intervention and track progress toward city-wide sustainability goals).


Instructions to use the application:

1. Open the Application
Navigate to the EnvironMap application interface.

2. Select the Borough
Use the dropdown menu under "Borough" to choose a London borough you're interested in.

Example: Greenwich

3. Choose the Environmental Factor
In the "Factor" dropdown, choose the type of environmental data to view:

Air Quality – Tracks PM2.5 and NO₂ levels.

Noise Pollution

CO₂ Emissions

4. Adjust the Year
Use the slider bar to select a year between the available range (e.g., 2020).

The selected year is displayed below the slider.

5. View the Map
Click the "Go" button to load data.

The selected borough will be highlighted on the map.

The map displays data through color-coded regions, making it easier to interpret spatial trends.

6. Explore Factor Information
On the right-hand side, read the Factor Information box for a summary of the environmental indicator selected.

To get more detailed data, click "Show Data Table".
